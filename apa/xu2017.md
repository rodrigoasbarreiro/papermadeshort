The role of alternative polyadenylation in the
antiviral innate immune response
==============================================

[http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14605]

The shortening in 3'UTR (+ less expression of 3'
processing factors) in viral response (vesicular
stomatitis virus; VSV) is linked with the viral
replication.

Introduction
------------
**APA modifies protein**

* Function;
* Stability;
* Localization;
* Transational efficiency;

**How?** 3'UTR is a 'docking plataform' for RNA
binding proteins and microRNA
